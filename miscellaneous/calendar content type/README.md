# Google Calendar

To use the 'clandar' content type, you need a helper script, using Google Apps Script. To use Google Apps Script to get all events for the next day and return them via JSON in a web app, you can follow these steps:

* Create a new Google Apps Script project by going to [https://script.google.com](https://script.google.com) and clicking on "New project".
* Paste the content of the calendar.js file into the editor
  This App Script calls the `getEventsForNextDay()` function to get the events in JSON format, creates a text output with the JSON content, sets the MIME type to JSON, and returns the output.

* Deploy the web app by clicking on "Deploy > New Deployment" in the script editor
* Choose "Web app" as the deployment type
* Set 'run as' to 'me', and the access to "Anyone, even anonymous"
* click on "Deploy"
* Make sure to take note of the web app URL generated by Google.
* Test the web app by visiting the web app URL in a web browser. You should see the events for the next day in JSON format.
